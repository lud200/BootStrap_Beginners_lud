	In graphic design Grid is a structure made up of straight 
	and vertical lines used to structure the content. It is widely
	used to design content structure. 

	Bootstrap is mobile first. 

	What does mobile first mean? 
	It means that Boot strap designs a web page for mobile version for 
	smaller screens and then expands the components to larger screens 
	such as laptops and desktops. 

	Mobile first Strategy:
	Step 1:
		Determine what is important
	Step 2:
		Design to smaller widths first. 
		Base CSS address for mobile, tablet and then desktop. 
	Step 3:
		Progressive Enhancement.
		Add elements as the size of the screen increases. 

	Rules to be followed for designing a grid system:
		Rule 1:
			Rows must be placed in ".container" class for proper padding. 
		Rule 2:
			Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns. 
		Rule 3:
			Content should be placed in columns and columns will be immediate 
			children of rows. 
		Rule 4:
			Predefined grid classes like .row and .col-xs-4 are available for 
			quickly making grid layouts. LESS mixins can also be used for 
			more semantic layouts.
		Rule 5:
			Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. 
			That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via 
			negative margin on .rows.
		Rule 6:
			Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve 
			available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns 
			would use three .col-xs-4.
